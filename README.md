Drought Severity Prediction in Maharashtra, India
This repository contains the research and implementation of a machine learning-based system to predict drought severity in Maharashtra, India. The project leverages the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and climate features influenced by the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillations (ENSO).
Overview
Droughts significantly affect agriculture, water resources, and rural livelihoods, especially in rainfed regions like Maharashtra. This study employs a Logistic Regression Model to predict drought severity, using historical climate data from NASA POWER (2001-2021). The system provides actionable insights for drought preparedness by forecasting SPI values for 1, 3, and 6 months.
Key Features:
Machine Learning Model: Predicts drought severity with high accuracy based on SPI values.
ENSO Analysis: Explores the relationship between ENSO indicators (SOI, ONI) and drought occurrences.
Data-Driven Insights: Highlights increasing frequency and severity of droughts in Maharashtra.
Feature Engineering: Utilizes key meteorological parameters such as precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture.
Dataset
The project uses publicly available data from the NASA POWER platform. Features include:
Meteorological Variables: Precipitation, surface pressure, soil wetness, temperature, wind speed.
Climate Indices: SOI, ONI.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling using StandardScaler.
Feature Selection: Pearson correlation, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Random Forest.
Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with scree plot analysis.
Modeling: Logistic Regression for drought classification based on SPI.
SPI Categories:
SPI Range	Drought Category
> 2.0	Extremely Wet
1.5 to 1.99	Very Wet
1.0 to 1.49	Moderately Wet
-0.99 to 0.99	Near Normal
-1.0 to -1.49	Moderately Dry
-1.5 to -1.99	Severely Dry
< -2.0	Extremely Dry
Results
Accuracy: The model accurately predicts drought severity for 1, 3, and 6-month horizons.
Findings: Notable drought events (2002, 2008, 2012, 2013) were correctly identified.
ENSO Impact: A strong correlation between ENSO phases and drought occurrences was observed.
Future Work
Expand analysis with updated datasets.
Integrate additional climate variables for improved accuracy.
Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
